# Coursera-Python
The repo where I save my code for past Coursera Python projects. Will post the code once the deadlines in those various classes are past.

Most of the code needs to be run in codeskuptor.org

If the module simplegui is imported, then run it in codeskulptor; else run it anywhere.

Games added:
- Blackjack
- Stopwatch
- Memory
- Pong
